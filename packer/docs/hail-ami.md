## Description

A CloudFormation template will deploy AWS CodeBuild Projects that can be used to build specific combinations of [Hail](https://hail.is), [Spark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-spark.html), and [VEP](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html).  The local packer folder is zipped and pushed to an S3 bucket to be used as the build source.

The Hail master branch HEAD can be used as a build source by **omitting** the `HAIL_VERSION` variable from your CodeBuild Project in CloudFormation.

[VEP](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) installation can also be excluded by **omitting** the `VEP_VERSION` environment variable.

## Prerequisites

- `hail-ami.yml` CloudFormation template successfully deployed
- AWS CLI profile with access to copy files to the S3 bucket/path specified in the CloudFormation template

## Deployment

Each time a file changes under the `packer` directory you must zip and push directory up to S3.  CodeBuild will pull this zip file in for each build.

From the `hail/packer` directory, zip the contents and move it to an S3 bucket/key that matches the parameters set in your CloudFormation.

## Building

Before building, keep the following in mind:

- Builds can take upwards of 90 minutes.
- AMI names are unique.  If building an updated AMI, deregister the previous.

From the AWS CodeBuild dashboard, select **Build projects** then the desired build's radio button and click **Start build**.

On the next page open the **Environment variable override** section and enter values specific to your build.

The `VEP_VERSION` identifies what version of VEP the build will pull from the AWS Registry of Online Data (RODA) S3 bucket. The `CORE_VAR_FILE` should be updated appropriately if you adjust the var file location in your `packer.zip`.  Values in green may be adjusted if desired.  Their defaults are set via CloudFormation.

Once the build beings you can optionally tail logs to view progress.  Closing this window will not terminate the build.
